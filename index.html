                        <p>The Familiars were formed in late 2010 by friends
                        Nick and Steve. Since the early days we have greatly
                        expanded our play list, and have progressed from
                        popular pub band to emerge as an exciting new
                        function band.</p>

                        <p>The Familiars play songs from a variety of artists
                        such as: - Prince, Snow Patrol, David Bowie, Zutons,
                        Madness, Foster the People, Kaiser Chiefs, Reef,
                        The Rolling Stones, Semisonic, Take That, Pink,
                        Red Hot Chilli Peppers, Bob Marley, James Brown,
                        Robbie Williams, the Police, Lenny Kravitz,
                        The Killers, Scouting for Girls, Van Morrison,
                        Stevie Wonder, Wild Cherry etc. etc.</p>

                        <p>Based in and around Cambridge we rehearse regularly
                        at our drummer Rob's own studio in Cambridge. The
                        current repertoire includes rock/pop songs from the 1960s
                        to the current day, and even a small collection of
                        quality jazz standards (if required for special
                        occasions such as during function meals).
                        The Familiars predominantly play great music to
                        dance to with a few terrific slower, yet powerful
                        numbers (including a couple of our own original
                        songs).  Above all we want YOU and your friends,
                        family, or colleagues, to have A BRILLIANT TIME!</p>

                        <p>The Familiars are available for pubs, clubs,
                        weddings, private parties and other functions.</p>
